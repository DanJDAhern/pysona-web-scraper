# Pysona Web Scraper

A simple Python-based web scraper, specifically designed to gather and compartmentalise information laid out on [Montyzu's PSN Profiles 100% Perfect Schedule guide for Persona 5 Royal on PS5.](https://psnprofiles.com/guide/11946-persona-5-royal-100-perfect-schedule#2-april)

This is intended to eventually be used to power an interactive Persona 5 Royal task tracker, something I've wanted to create for a while. This project is being used to teach myself full-stack development.

# Dependencies

**Python** - The heart of the project - drives all main logic.
**BeautifulSoup** - Gathers and processes the HTML data from the page.
**Pandas** - Provides the ability to output a data table to a .CSV format.

# How to Use
Due to how specific the usage is for this project, it's unlikely you'd need to run the program yourself - when I've finished, the full output will be made available for free, in multiple file formats.

That being said, should you wish to run this locally, it should be as simple as
1) Download the project files.
2) Extract them to a sensible directory of your choosing.
3) Run the "web.py" file.
4) In the same directory, you will find Export.csv, containing your exported data.

# Modifications
In time, I would like to expand this tool to allow me to do the same for other Atlus RPGs that have similar sets of actions, and potentially other games too, such as Persona 3 Reload, Metaphor: Refantazio, or even something completely different like Stardew Valley.

If you wish to modify this, go ahead - I'd love to see what you come up with!

# Credits
[**Montyzu**](https://psnprofiles.com/Montyzu) - The PSNProfiles user who went to the trouble of creating the 100% completion guide in the first place. This 		 would literally not exist without their hard work. Thank you!

[**Thomas Janssen**](https://www.youtube.com/@TomsTechAcademy) - The amazing Youtuber whose video spurred this idea in the first place. Their video on [Webscraping with Python and BeautifulSoup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBzrMw8hkmY) was all I needed to get up and running.
